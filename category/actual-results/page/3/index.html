<p>Remember the original Willy Wonka movie from 1971? Turns out they were saying the same things about kids back then too. It&#8217;s not just millennials, I feel better now.</p>

<p>Even though I&#8217;m an impatient millennial, I have the right perspective on my rental property investments, which is why I have never hesitated to contact a property management firm similar to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Eagle+Property+Management,+LLC/@45.4037511,-122.6745558,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549574909696fed5:0xebdc7cdab1925e7b!8m2!3d45.4037511!4d-122.6745558">Eagle Property Management, LLC</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, let the world say whatever it wants to. We will just continue our work. So, let us take a look at what happened in October and why it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<h2>Quick Overview for First Time Visitors</h2>
<p>I currently own 3 rental properties. </p>
<p>My goal is to generate some impressive turns over multiple decades while taking a passive approach &#8211; spend a little more time than index fund investing for much greater returns.</p>
<p>The impressive returns are possible by taking advantage of the ridiculously attractive leverage available. Multiply appreciation (expected to be just the rate of inflation) by 4 to 5 times!</p>
<p><em>     See: <a href="/thing-investors-dont-understand-leverage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Thing Most Investors Don&#8217;t Understand about Leverage</a></em></p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t have to be risky. Rather than chasing what is sexy, I buy in boring markets that have a health cash flow. The cash flow is a margin of safety to make sure I can always make payments and stay in the game for a long long time.</p>
<p>I expect 20-25% overall yearly returns over decades. Since the market has been going up for a while now, I&#8217;m ahead of pace &#8211; so far I&#8217;ve earned 30% a year over 6+ years.</p>
<p>Every 6 months I dig into the complete numbers: <a href="/6-months-9596-dollars-rental-property-portfolio-update/">6 Months, $9596 More Dollars – Rental Property Portfolio Update</a></p>
<p>Monthly I do a quick cash flow and time spent report. Now let&#8217;s get into it!</p>

<p>No deposits into my checking account. Bummer.</p>
<p>There will be expenses of $90 for property management and $760 PITI (so high because I did a cash out refinance).</p>
<p>Time spent? 5 minutes on the phone following up on how much the property manager collected and when to expect it in my account. </p>
<p>I found out the total rent collected for October was $700, with another $500 to $700 expected on Friday November 2nd. So they fell a little farther behind (currently all of October and November) and we are getting a payment plan in writing.</p>
<h2>Memphis #1</h2>

Purchased in 2014 for $93k, rent $1020</em></p>
<p>The rent of $1020 was collected. Property management is 10%, so $102. $560 goes to PITI. No other expenses.<strong> So in September cash flow was $358.</strong></p>
<p>I spent <strong>0 minutes</strong> on this property in October. </p>
<p>Last month the tenant signed a new 2 year lease with modest rent increases of $1035 the first year and $1045 the second year. Which means no tenant turnover any time soon and minimal time invested in keeping up with this property.</p>
<h2>Memphis #2</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-30-at-7.12.05-AM-e1507130601771.png" alt="memphis #2" width="567" height="334" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-523" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-30-at-7.12.05-AM-e1507130601771.png 567w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-30-at-7.12.05-AM-e1507130601771-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px"><em>5 bed 2 bath, 2200 square feet<br>
Purchased in 2017 for $105k, rent $1100</em></p>
<p>This is the latest property that closed on September 22nd.</p>
<p><em>    See: <a href="/surprising-95-day-closing-rental-property-3/">The Surprising 95 Day Closing of Rental Property #3</a></em></p>
<p>The property was vacant at the beginning of October, so we needed to find a tenant as soon as possible. Overall it went pretty well and I spent maybe 60 to 90 minutes communicating with the property manager.</p>
<p>It took a little longer to place the tenant than I would have hoped &#8211; the rehab finished in mid-August and it took another month to get it appraised and closed. Then it took another month until the tenant moved in. Ideally there would have been a sense of urgency to get those done at the same time, but it is better to take an extra week or two to find a high quality tenant.</p>
<p>The tenant signed a 1 year lease for $1100 a month. Seems like a quality tenant too, no evictions or credit issues. Military job, which should be pretty stable.  </p>
<p>The move in date was October 20th. We received the prorated portion for October and November in full, so $1490. Expected expenses on that are 58% &#8211; 50% for tenant placement, 8% for monthly property management. So $626 to me, but then $598 for PITI.</p>
<p>But the money hasn&#8217;t hit my account yet. <strong>So either a tiny $28 cash flow or a negative October balanced out by a big November. However you want to look at it.</strong></p>
<h2>Total? Whatever</h2>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-clueless-movie-xT9KVeEPWqBlmDLgME" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/giphy.gif" alt="" width="480" height="270" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-573"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to bother picking numbers for each property to consider as my October cash flow. Doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t it matter? The end of a month is an arbitrary and short cut off that makes things look good or bad, when they might just even out the next month.</p>
<p>In October the cash flow was horrible. Over examining a mediocre month can result in over reacting. I&#8217;d rather zoom out and take a long term view.</p>
<p>Cash flow into my bank account was poor, but I there should be deposits in the next week to even it out. No big deal.</p>
<p>Plus I shouldn&#8217;t myopically focus on cash flow. There are other components of overall return that are just as important. The tenants paid down the mortgages for me in October about $350. There were tax benefits and appreciation. I review all these every 6 months.</p>

<h2>How Were Your October Returns?</h2>
<p>That&#8217;s the quick update from me, how did your month go?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a rental property yet, how did you get closer to your goal in the last month?</p>
<p>Do you examine things monthly or is that too much of a short-term focus?</p>
<p>Let me know!</p>

<p>        <em>See: <a href="/locked-third-rental-property-investment/">How I Locked Up My Third Rental Property Investment</a></em></p>
<h2>First Some Thoughts</h2>
<p>I was previously hesitant to give monthly updates because usually nothing much happens and it is too zoomed in to get any feel for how the numbers work out long term.</p>
<p>I finally caved. My goal is to show you <strong>how little time I typically spend with my passive approach to rental property investing</strong>. </p>
<p>And hopefully the numbers on those <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/building-a-sales-forecast-guide/">sales forecast</a> and rental data are compelling, but I don&#8217;t really worry about them too much. I have a decades-long approach to rental property investing, so any individual month isn&#8217;t that vital. </p>
<p>Not to mention the cash flow numbers are just one part of the overall return. Twice a year I go through all the numbers: appreciation, tax benefits, mortgage pay down, and more. I&#8217;ve found that <a href="https://learn.roofstock.com/blog/financing-rental-property" alt="" title="">financing rental property from Roofstock </a>is a much more sensible approach; it helps you to save as well as making the Landlord life much easier. </p>

<p>The tenant has been in the property for over 6 years, as long as I have owned it. That&#8217;s the good news. The bad news is they are typically 2-6 weeks behind on rent at any given time.</p>
<p>This month they are getting caught back up &#8211; moving from 6 weeks behind to around 2. Let&#8217;s see if they get all the way caught up. </p>
<p>I received deposits in my checking account of $810 and $500. That&#8217;s after the expense of $90 for property management services similar to this <a href="https://www.hlb.com.au/locations/adelaide/property-management/">Property Management Adelaide</a> firm can provide to property investors. And before $760 PITI (so high because I did a cash out refinance). <strong>So this month my cash flow was $550 on this rental property.</strong></p>
<p>How long did it take to earn this money? <strong>10 minutes</strong>. I made a quick phone call to the property manager between the deposits to find out the payment plan they worked out (paying $600 every 2 weeks until caught up).</p>

Purchased in 2014 for $93k, rent $1020</em></p>
<p>The rent of $1020 was collected. Property management is 10%, so $102. The plumber had to come out to replace the flapper on a leaking toilet, which came to $103. Then $560 goes to PITI. <strong>So in September cash flow was $255.</strong></p>
<p>I spent about <strong>20 minutes</strong> on this property because a new lease was signed and I went through the paperwork to find out the details.</p>
<p>This tenant started a 2 year lease in March 2016. It really did not start out well with the new tenant. After 10 months, we were averaging $225 a month in repairs. Ouch. It seemed like this tenant called about any minor thing.</p>
<p><em>        See: <a href="http://My Roller Coaster Cash Flow on a Rental Property Investment/">My Roller Coaster Cash Flow on a Rental Property Investment</a></em></p>
<p>It has been 10 months since then with minimal repairs. I won&#8217;t go through now and add it up, but just a few hundred total including this month&#8217;s toilet fix. Of course, it&#8217;s important to ensure that your home fixtures are repaired properly so that they will not require any further repairs. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s always best to choose people (plumbers in this case) that are reliable and well known. If you&#8217;re in need of a reliable plumber just like I was, you might want to have a look at a site like <a style="color: #0077c;" href="https://sharpplumbing.com/service-areas/hopkinton-ma/plumbing-services/">sharpplumbing.com/service-areas/hopkinton-ma/plumbing-services/</a> for more information on how you can ensure that your plumbing needs are met to your standards.</p>
<p>Replacing a tenant is expensive. On this property the 2016 tenant turnover cost $2400 between fees and the property being vacant for a little while.</p>
<p><em>        See: <a href="/tenant-turnover-thousands-miles-away/">Tenant Turnover From Thousands of Miles Away</a></em></p>
<p>So considering this tenant stabilized with fewer maintenance calls, I wanted her to stay. This property management company is on top of it &#8211; they already approached the tenant to sign a new lease before it is up in March 2018.</p>
<p><strong>The tenant signed a new 2 year lease with modest rent increases of $1035 the first year and $1045 the second year</strong>. For re-upping for 2 years the tenant receives $150 off their March 2018 rent.</p>
<p>The rent increase is nice, but the big win here is avoiding the need to find a new tenant, which costs $1.5-2.5k and gives back a huge chunk of your hard earned cash flow.</p>

Purchased in 2017 for $105k, rent $1100 (pending)</em></p>
<p>This is the latest property &#8211; I closed on September 22nd.</p>
<p><em>        See: <a href="/surprising-95-day-closing-rental-property-3/">The Surprising 95 Day Closing of Rental Property #3</a></em></p>
<p>How much time did I spent on the closing in September? <strong>Maybe 2 and a half hours</strong>. I received the appraisal and went through it to understand the comps used. I received the closing package by email and read through all the documents before the notary came over to have me sign.</p>
<p><strong>Since the closing I have spent maybe 15 minutes.</strong> I called a few times to get an update on the placement of the tenant. They outsource it to someone else, which once again makes communication tricky.</p>
<p>Things are in motion, but honestly not off to a great start with this new property management company. My phone calls typically go to voicemail and my messages typically aren&#8217;t returned. I&#8217;m beginning to think email will work best with them.</p>
<p>How about the cash flow? Nothing yet. It will hopefully rent at $1100 soon with 8% going to the property manager and $598 for PITI. The first mortgage payment isn&#8217;t due until November 1st though, so no expenses yet.</p>
<h2>$805 in 3 hours and 15 Minutes</h2>
<p>Total cash flow in September was $805 against 3 hours and 15 minutes spent. </p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/aziz-ansari-tom-haverford-gauzBevJxeJHy" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/giphy-13.gif" alt="" width="437" height="247" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528"></a></p>
<p>Obvious caveats apply like setting aside money for maintenance, repairs, tenant turnover, etc. There will be negative months. </p>
<p>Most of the time was spent on the closing. Once property #3 is rented, I should hopefully spend only about an hour a month keeping an eye on all three.</p>
<h2>The Snowball is Gaining Mass</h2>
<p>On my <a data-sumome-listbuilder-id="057e8f2a-7f43-4944-91ba-657130d08396">email list</a> I discuss how I think of my portfolio as a snowball rolling down the hill.</p>
<p><strong>With each turn the snowball gathers more mass &#8211; the bigger it is, the more it gains &#8211; exponential growth.</strong> It starts slowly at first though, barely noticeable.</p>
<p>After the refi on property #1 and purchase of property #3, I feel like I have turned a corner on the exponential growth of my rental portfolio.</p>
<p>By reinvesting the cash flow, my properties can feed the buying of more properties, which increases the cash flow and speeds up the ability to buy the next property.</p>
<p>I still have some proceeds from the cash out refinance and I just cashflowed $805 in one month. Pretty soon I&#8217;ll have enough for the next rental property!</p>

<p>A mobile notary came over to my house last Friday with a huge stack of papers for me to sign. I&#8217;d heard about these types of <a href="https://precedentlegalca.com/">mobile notary support services washington d.c.</a> and those that are similar before, and they are all highly regarded in the eyes of law firms and others when important documents need to be signed as soon as possible. It tends to happen when lawyers find themselves under time pressure and they can&#8217;t get the job done themselves. Although, as long as it gets done, I don&#8217;t think it matters who does it. They&#8217;re all on the same side after all. That drew to an end a <strong>surprisingly long 95 days since my verbal commitment to the seller</strong>.</p>
<p>No, the slow part wasn&#8217;t the notary&#8230; The assumption is that the notary is what makes it a tedious process but as long as you go to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/rachel-mintz-mobile-notary-public-los-angeles">a mobile notary in the Los Angeles area</a> (or the one in Washington) like Rachel Mintz did, then the process shouldn&#8217;t take too long.</p>

<h2>Recapping the Deets</h2>
<p>It is a big 5 bed, 2 bath in a Memphis suburb. Purchased for $105k should rent for $1100.</p>
<p><em>        Details on finding the property: <a href="/locked-third-rental-property-investment/">How I Locked Up My Third Rental Property Investment</a></em></p>
<p>Here is the after rehab video:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZZiXMulYEQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>What Took So Long?</h2>
<p>The appraisal.</p>
<p>It started with a request from me in late July that the lender hold on ordering the appraisal. I wanted to make sure the rehab work was finalized, but I made a couple mistakes.</p>
<p>I thought I was delaying the appraisal <strong>and</strong> inspection, but the inspection had already been ordered. Ooops. The inspection and appraisal helped to value the house and ensure it was in good enough condition. Thankfully, we had sorted most of the problems. Before starting the job, we had checked for any signs of pests by contacting <a href="https://www.pestcontrolexperts.com/">https://www.pestcontrolexperts.com/</a>, so we knew the house was clean and hygienic. </p>
<p>The rehab was almost finished, so I just wanted to wait another few days. I thought there was still plenty of time before our original target closing date of mid-August. </p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t exactly on top of things though. My wife and I went from a Flagstaff family reunion, to Chicago to celebrate my mom&#8217;s 60th birthday, to Bigfork  Montana for a wedding. During the two week trip, real estate wasn&#8217;t always top of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/debbyryan-debby-ryan-3oKIPwO2M2VP0yWjFS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/source-1.gif" alt="insane week" width="640" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-516"></a></p>
<p>A week and a half went by before the bank reached out and said &#8220;can we order the appraisal?&#8221; I said &#8220;oops, go ahead&#8221;.</p>
<h2>The Appraisal Process</h2>
<p>Turns out I shouldn&#8217;t have delayed anyways because appraisals are slow going these days. I assumed it would have been like the last purchase I made in 2014. Given the tons of home sales in 2017, it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><em>        I should have read:<a href="/turnkey-rentals-2017-need-adjust-approach/">Turnkey Rentals in 2017: Why You Need to Adjust Your Approach</a></em></p>
<p>One of the issues that led to the financial crisis was appraisers weren&#8217;t exactly independent. Banks could choose who they used, going with appraisers who would do whatever the banks wanted &#8211; essentially always quickly giving back a good valuation.</p>
<p>Now there is an intermediary. The lender puts in a request to a separate appraisal scheduling company (who I will refer to as &#8220;the appraisal desk&#8221;). This company has a pool of appraisers they use, and assign someone without the bank being involved.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great and all, but boy did it slow things down! My lender&#8217;s communication with this outsourced appraisal desk was like a <strong>game of telephone: slow and unreliable</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/coin-music-video-talk-too-much-l0MZhvVaefR03KDok" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/giphy-9.gif" alt="game of telephone" width="480" height="270" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-517"></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I delayed the start 1.5 weeks accidentally</li>
<li>Appraisal is ordered and it takes 1 week for appraiser #1 to call the seller to schedule</li>
<li>The seller rejected the appraiser after he supposedly said he doesn&#8217;t use rentals as comps, so he requested it be reassigned to a new appraiser</li>
<li>Another week goes by before appraiser #2 reaches out</li>
<li>Appraiser #2 calls the seller and leaves a voicemail. Then he tells the appraisal desk he is too busy for the job, so turns it down.</li>
<li>That same day the seller calls appraiser #2 back and he agrees to take the job. They schedule a date and just have to let the appraisal desk know it&#8217;s back on.</li>
<li>The appraisal desk never gets back to him before the scheduled appraisal date, so appraiser #2 cancels the appointment</li>
<li>Meanwhile it has been assigned to appraiser #3, but it took another week for him to call and schedule for a week out</li>
<li>Appraiser #3 turns in the report to the appraisal desk, but there are unknown delays. Maybe they wanted to replace a comp or two?</li>
<li>Two weeks after the initial appraisal was submitted, I get a copy</li>
<li>Closing is scheduled for 1 week later</li>
</ul>
<p>What a mess!</p>
<p>It would have been so much easier if the appraisal desk had simply kept with appraiser #2 and replied to his emails. It seems like there was a 1 week delay any time someone contacted the appraisal desk. <strong>Maybe emails are printed and delivered by pony express?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/giphy-11.gif" alt="pony express" width="245" height="140" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-519"></p>
<p><strong>Throughout this I was talking to my two contacts (seller and lender), trying to facilitate communication between two other people (appraisal desk and appraiser).</strong></p>
<p>When the mess with appraiser #2 was happening, my lender said: &#8220;You are way more involved at this point that 99% of buyers.&#8221;</p>
<p>To which I replied: &#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve lost confidence in your chain of communication and ability to get this done.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, the appraisal came back as expected ($105k) and everything was a go.</p>
<h2>What Did I Learn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes things don&#8217;t go as planned&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/Jalikml2XiUgw" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/giphy-10.gif" alt="fail gif" width="240" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-518"> </a></p>
<p>Just like working with a property manager, I found myself working the lender to instill a sense of urgency. If they had a task to take care of, I was making daily phone calls.</p>
<p>One of my take-aways is that the lender isn&#8217;t the only person I needed to worry about &#8211; whoever they outsource the appraisals to is important as well. I&#8217;m not sure I could have known this ahead of time, but I sure didn&#8217;t feel there was a good enough channel of communication between them. Or that the lender was on my side and hustling enough. When it comes to selling a property, I may prefer a buyer who can buy my property as fast as possible (click <a href="https://webuyhousesinatlanta.com/">https://webuyhousesinatlanta.com/</a> for more information) rather than putting it out on any website and waiting for homebuyers to reach out to me.</p>
<p>So next time I&#8217;ll probably go back to the lender (#1) I used on my first two properties (the refi was also through lender #2). It was a tiny more expensive, but worth it.</p>
<p>I also learned that I shouldn&#8217;t assume I know everything just because this is my 3rd rental property. It wasn&#8217;t exactly the same as last time and I made a small mistake because of it (while distracted with my personal life).</p>
<p>Fresh eyes with a beginner&#8217;s mindset next time.</p>
<h2>All Good Now</h2>
<p>The seller could have backed out and found another buyer since it was beyond our initially agreed upon window. Or the appraisal could have finally come back too low.</p>
<p>Even though it took a while, everything worked out in the end. So all things considered, waiting a bit longer is no big deal!</p>
<p><strong>I want to hear from you &#8211; have you had any surprises during a rental property closing process? Did it work out in the end?</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>I&#8217;ve always looked at things a bit differently than most, somehow devoid of the fear of looking stupid by going against the crowd.</p>
<p>Five years ago, at the age of 25, I quit my well-paying Silicon Valley tech job and blasted out this email to everyone I knew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever been to a wild and crazy retirement party? Well this Friday night is your chance – we are celebrating the fact that it is my last day of work and throwing an ABBA themed retirement bash.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right – a party featuring all ABBA music. Gems like Dancing Queen, Take a Chance on Me, Fernando, and Waterloo (you can look forward to both the English and Swedish versions).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a good time, although I could tell by the 2nd hour of ABBA not everyone was as into the music as I was&#8230;</p>
<p>That one action (leaving my job, not throwing an ABBA retirement party) put me on the path to financial freedom. I&#8217;m not there yet, but getting started is the hardest part. Whether you&#8217;re quitting your job, like me, applying for a <a href="http://www.easyfinance.com/blog/things-you-should-spend-your-money-on/">credit card with no credit history</a> or paying off a mountain of debt, the road to financial freedom is always bumpy but you have to persevere. It will be well worth it.
</p>
<p>Today I am a small business owner in an area I&#8217;m passionate about and building a passive income through investing in out-of-state rental properties.</p>
<h3>Where My Journey Began</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people are born on third base and go through life thinking they hit a triple<br>
-Barry Switzer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote struck me the first time I heard it. And not just because I love baseball.</p>
<p>Across the landscape of financial blogs there are people in many different positions, from broke to rich. If you are signed up for the Gen Y email list you know the hardships he had to overcome to get where he is today. Others are riddled with student loan debt that will take decades to repay. Then there are a few with millions in net worth.</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate to start my journey in an excellent position – I won the genetic lottery with a loving upper-middle class family in California suburbia. You could say I was born on third base.</p>
<p>Rather, I prefer to think of it this way: the ball was hit to the deepest part of the ballpark for me, all I had to do was hustle my way around the bases to get to third. There are many people who have the same advantages and decide to coast into second base.</p>
<p>The goal is to make it all the way to the home plate though: financial freedom. Reaching third base is worth zero runs.</p>
<h3>The Working World</h3>
<p>I entered the workforce in 2008 with an engineering degree from Stanford and no student loans. Terrific starting position.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is the place to be for tech jobs and I landed a role at an enterprise software company. Making pretty decent money too.</p>
<p>I just couldn&#8217;t imagine staying there forever. Or any company really. It&#8217;s so slow! I just don&#8217;t enjoy small talk around the water cooler. Keep doing this another thirty to forty years? No thank you.</p>
<p>After three years I knew the gig was up – it was time for me to move on to the next thing.</p>

It challenges the idea of waiting until 65 for a traditional retirement and proposes an alternative. Some call it a sabbatical – every few years taking several months off.</p>
<p>I knew if I was going to be finding a new job anyway, this would be a perfect opportunity to see the world.</p>
<p>So I quit, threw an ABBA party, moved out of my apartment, and started a new journey.</p>
<h3>The Second Chapter</h3>
<p>After traveling for 5 months, mostly in New Zealand, it was back to reality. I would have to work again eventually. The first retirement wasn&#8217;t meant to last.</p>
<p>But I got to thinking – if I don&#8217;t like the traditional workplace, it should be a fall back option, not the primary goal. This employment gap might be the best chance I have to start my own small business and work for myself in an area I&#8217;m passionate about.</p>
<p>It would mean going through a tough period with very little income, but if successful, I&#8217;d be in a much better position in the long run.</p>
<p>And if it didn&#8217;t work, at least I&#8217;d be able to go back to traditional employment knowing that I&#8217;d given it my all. No second guessing, wondering if there was a better way to make a living.</p>
<p>The business I started is <a href="http://breakoutmentors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1-on-1 mentoring for kids who are learning to code</a>. I&#8217;m able to make decisions to go about it the right way, not simply the easiest way to make money. I&#8217;m able to fit work around my life, not the other way around.</p>
<h3>But What About Financial Freedom?</h3>
<p>If I&#8217;m currently on third base, how do I reach home plate? My plan to get there is through passive income.</p>
<p>There is more than one path to financial freedom. Some recommend cutting expenses by doing things like making your own deodorant or getting your ketchup from the free packets at McDonald&#8217;s. Most advocate saving a huge chunk of money and reaching a certain account balance before retiring and living off a small percentage per year.</p>
<p>I want money to keep coming in and to be able to spend. I know I haven&#8217;t reached my peak spending years yet and don&#8217;t want to sit at home hoarding pennies.</p>
<p>Passive income sounds great. Everyone wants it. You just sit there and money keeps coming in? Sign me up!</p>
<p>Unfortunately there isn&#8217;t exactly a clear path that works for everyone. It is hard – you have to invest either time or money up front. It is also uncertain – your plan for riches might be a complete bust. Most people suck at rebounding from failure and never try again.</p>
<p>I believe it&#8217;s easiest to start earning passive income by investing both your money and your time.</p>
<p>Put your money to work because there is less competition – everyone wants passive income streams that require $0, so those methods are highly competitive. Instead invest your time in finding a better way to put your money to work and learn how to do it.</p>
<h3>Which Led Me to Rental Property Investing</h3>
<p>Rental properties are a proven way to build both wealth and passive income, with many using software packages (like <a href="https://getbrokerkit.com/home/7-ways-to-improve-your-real-estate-recruitment/">https://getbrokerkit.com/home/7-ways-to-improve-your-real-estate-recruitment/</a>) to help them with managing these properties. You purchase a property and a tenant pays you every month – if you do it right, substantially more than your expenses. Meanwhile the property is appreciating, the tenant is paying down the mortgage, and you get tax benefits. Most people don&#8217;t consider <a href="/the-impressive-returns-of-remote-rental-property-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all 5 components of return for rental properties</a>.</p>
<p>The world of real estate is huge. There are thousands of <a href="/want-guru-look-somewhere-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gurus</a> preaching hundreds of different ways to do things. There are expensive courses, workshops, and conferences. It is all very intimidating.</p>
<p>Yet the majority of failures are those who don&#8217;t get started at all. They worry over details and worst case scenarios &#8220;my cousin&#8217;s next door neighbor has a rental property where the tenant didn&#8217;t pay rent and used the bathtub as a toilet&#8221;. Most of the time you will find reasonable people who just want to look for <a href="https://www.delsuites.com/locations/north-york-furnished-apartments.php">apartments for rent north york</a> that are clean and simple, and are perfectly fine. But the worries bog people down.</p>
<p>They over analyze rather than taking a less than 100% perfect step 1. So how do you simplify step 1?</p>
<h3>My Plan</h3>
<p>I am starting with turnkey rental properties on the other side of the country. I live in San Francisco, which is too expensive for rental numbers to work. You want the rent each month to be <a href="/ratios-baby-invest-rentals-thousands-miles-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 1/100th of the purchase price</a>. In San Francisco it is closer to 1/300th.</p>
<p>Turnkey is when a company does a lot of the work for you. They buy distressed properties, fix them up, put a tenant in place, then sell the property to an investor. In the end you own the property and the turnkey company makes a profit for their work – their model is flipping homes, mine is holding for the long term benefits.</p>
<p>I hire professional property managers to take care of most the on-going work because <a href="https://www.propertymanagementgroup.com/">managing properties</a> is incredibly difficult when you have more than three. That allows it to be passive income, not a second job as a landlord.</p>
<p>Right now my typical deal might have a $100k purchase price, requiring 20% down plus closing costs for an initial investment of $23k. The property rents for $1k per month, and after all projected expenses, it will provide $150 per month in cash flow.</p>
<p>And remember, cash flow is just one aspect of the overall return. <a href="/behind-the-numbers-calculating-the-overall-return-of-my-rental-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over the last four and a half years, my properties have produced a 29% annual return</a>. This is possible even with conservative investments thanks to low-risk leverage, which <a href="/thing-investors-dont-understand-leverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most people don&#8217;t understand</a>.</p>
<h3>My Advice</h3>
<p>Research rental property investing and consider if it will help you reach financial freedom. It&#8217;s not for everyone and there are always risks when doing something different. I write about my own personal journey and how I reduce my risk at <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rental Mindset</a>.</p>
<p>The number one book to for motivation is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680011/ref=as_li_bk_tl/?tag=rentalminds02-20&amp;linkId=3a11bb3ce3975049d642c61ef056f71e&amp;linkCode=ktl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="amznPsBmPixel_2383959" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; width: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?source=bk&#038;t=yomoyobo-20&#038;bm-id=default&#038;l=ktl&#038;linkId=3a11bb3ce3975049d642c61ef056f71e&#038;_cb=1461163073836" alt="" width="0" height="0" border="0">. It will drive home the goal of passive income through rental properties. Don&#8217;t expect to ever find a perfect how-to guide, there are some things you will have to figure out on your own.</p>
<p>For more on turnkey rental properties, I recommend a couple podcasts. The earliest episodes from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/passive-real-estate-investing/id1006557991?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passive Real Estate Investing</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/turnkey-real-estate-investing/id955254558?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turnkey Real Estate Investing</a> will provide a nice overview.</p>
<p>Even if rental properties aren&#8217;t your thing, find a way to add passive income streams that you control. There are many ways to go about it and as you level-up your game, you will recognize more and more opportunities around you.</p>
<p>Put your money to work. Start simple. Don&#8217;t let fear of failure stop you.</p>
