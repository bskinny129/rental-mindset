<p>It is located in a Memphis suburb, currently being rehabbed by a top-notch turnkey company. Check it out!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.43.45-AM.png" alt="not great curb appeal" width="621" height="348" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-471" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.43.45-AM.png 621w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.43.45-AM-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px"></p>
<p>The curb appeal isn&#8217;t great but the numbers are. The purchase price of $105k will rent for $1150+ a month. That should make for a pretty good profit margin. Of course, the home needs some work doing before I can consider putting it on the rental market, but there isn&#8217;t that much to do. One of the first things that will probably need changing is the front door. It&#8217;s a bit worn and it isn&#8217;t very modern. When you&#8217;re putting a home on the market, it&#8217;s important to consider what most people will look for. For many potential buyers, they&#8217;re looking for more modern homes. This is why it&#8217;s important that I consider getting in contact with a <a href="https://www.kellywindowanddoor.com/doors/provia-replacement-doors-in-raleigh/">professional provia door installations</a> company to see if they can update the door and make the home look a little more modern. Hopefully, that will be a pretty good place to start with the curb appeal. </p>
<p>The curb appeal should be easily fixed, so I locked this house up! </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the property and my decision-making process.</p>
<h2>The Before Rehab Video</h2>
<p>The turnkey company posts walk through videos on YouTube. Here is the property before rehab has started.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qp6T2hh1l_4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Often the before pictures are pretty horrendous. That&#8217;s what these turnkey flippers specialize in &#8211; take an ugly house and improve it.</p>
<p>A property that will eventually be flipped to an investor at $105k might cost around $60k pre-rehab. With $25k of work put into it, including financing and other expenses, they can turn a profit of $20k. That is if everything goes according to plan. They have the risk and have to execute quickly.</p>
<p>As you can see, this property is in pretty good shape. It was built in the 1960s, but fixed up about 10 years ago. Most of it will be improved again.</p>
<p>What will the inside look like after rehab? Take a look at this video of a finished property by the same company.</p>

<h2>The Search</h2>
<p>This is me searching for rental properties.</p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/focusworld-focus-world-in-a-valley-of-violence-l2JhORT5IFnj6ioko" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/giphy-5.gif" alt="search for rental property" width="480" height="198" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-469"></a></p>
<p>I do my best work in a cowboy hat&#8230;</p>
<p>My actual process is to first decide the city, then decide a couple of turnkey companies I like in that city.</p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/starting-search-next-rental-property-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starting the Search for My Next Rental Property Investment</a> </em></p>
<p>All my properties so far have been through Jason Hartman&#8217;s investment network to make this a little easier. They currently work with 6 of the best turnkey companies in Memphis.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make the mistake of stopping there and waiting for properties to get posted to the website. In 2017 things move fast. </p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/turnkey-rentals-2017-need-adjust-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turnkey Rentals in 2017: Why You Need to Adjust Your Approach</a></em></p>
<p>You also probably want to filter those 6 providers down even further. Not all of them fit my criteria. </p>
<p>Some had numbers that were consistently not all that impressive. A couple were too big (100+ flips a year) which makes me worry about their quality and my voice being heard. Others weren&#8217;t strong communicators.</p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/mad-men-flirt-seduce-jd4YLfyVaHqik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/giphy-7.gif" alt="communicate" width="343" height="315" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-475"></a></p>
<p>I found 2 that I liked out of the 4 or 5 companies I researched. So that narrowed my search scope of potential properties considerably.</p>
<p>Both of those companies do around 60 turnkey flips a year, selling 5 rental properties a month to investors. It might take them roughly 1 month to buy the property and 1 month to do the rehab.</p>
<p>In 2017 most properties are put under contract before the rehab is finished. This means to get first dibs, you are committing to a property before it is rehabbed.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it is so important to focus on individual turnkey companies. That is the product you are buying, not the house.</p>
<p><strong>You are essentially buying the ability for the turnkey company to deliver an impressive property that appraises as expected. Someone with integrity who will fix anything uncovered by the inspection report. </strong></p>
<p>You still have the ability to back out later if you can&#8217;t agree on what should be fixed on the inspection report. It&#8217;s less than ideal though because you are out the price of the inspection (maybe $250) and a lot of time invested, including getting your financing in place.</p>
<h2>The Location</h2>
<p>My original Memphis property is in the Raleigh-Bartlett area, northwest of the city. It is a 20-25 minute drive to downtown.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.41.00-AM.png" alt="memphis map" width="461" height="385" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.41.00-AM.png 461w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.41.00-AM-300x251.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px"></p>
<p>I liked the area three years ago when I researched more thoroughly. The other area with a lot of turnkey investments to compare it to is south of downtown, by the airport.</p>
<p>Both have very solid job opportunities, but I liked the long term prospects of the northwestern suburbs a little more. More opportunity for growth to the north, touching on a very nice suburb of Bartlett, and not as old.</p>
<p>I did a little research comparing the suburbs again but largely trusted what I decided three years ago. Of course, I was open to the right deal elsewhere if necessary.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you know it, one of the two providers had a property in that area they were in the process of purchasing.</p>
<h2>The Details</h2>
<p>I thought I wasn&#8217;t interested when I first saw the property. </p>
<p>Built in 1968, it is way older than my other two rental properties that were built in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Plus the curb appeal sucked. First, the fact that it was an older property, but also the front yard is mostly dirt because of a huge tree that provides a little too much shade for healthy low-maintenance grass.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-10.14.55-AM.png" alt="that's a lot of dirt" width="633" height="473" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-473" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-10.14.55-AM.png 633w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-10.14.55-AM-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px"></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of dirt! But it is also before rehab&#8230; a little work can go a long way, but I don&#8217;t think it will ever be that impressive on the curb appeal. It would take a lot of work, and would probably be too much for me to take on. One of my friends was recently telling me about <a href="https://www.lawncare.net/">https://www.lawncare.net/</a>. She said they&#8217;d probably be able to improve the curb appeal of this house. This house would require a lot of jobs doing, from trying to plant a new lawn to cutting that tree slightly. It would probably need a professional landscaper to give it a good go!</p>
<p>Even with a freshened up lawn, the curb appeal could be increased by altering the exterior of the house; the windows, door, and roof combined make the home look very plain and dated. New windows could be installed to freshen up the house, as well as a more modern door, and inspiration could be taken from <a href="https://www.thinkbordner.com/kansas-city/roofing-contractors/">kansas city roofs</a> to perhaps replace it in a bid to make the building look more lively. These are all additions that&#8217;ll give the house some much-needed curb appeal. When replacing windows, it&#8217;s so important to consider looking into fiberglass windows. These are believed to be stronger than average windows, giving homeowners more protection from weather events. Perhaps this <a href="https://lifetimewindowscolorado.com/">window replacement company denver</a> could be useful to contact if anyone else has purchased an investment property in that area. If not, just search for window replacement companies local to you. They should be able to recommend the best windows to improve curb appeal. </p>
<p><strong>The numbers met my requirements though. With a purchase price of $105k and a rent of $1150 per month, which gives a 1.1% ratio. Great!</strong></p>
<p>One of the things you have to consider &#8211; is the rent projection believable? In this case, I believe it is. We might even be able to get more the first year! </p>
<p>The property is huge at 2200 square feet &#8211; 5 bedrooms plus an office or walk-in closet, 2 bathrooms. It looks like a freshly rehabbed 4/2 might be around $1150 a month, so a 5+/2 might draw a little bit of a premium. I&#8217;m also intrigued by the idea that a large family or someone with a lot of stuff to store is less likely to move. Keeping tenants for a long time is a huge factor for cash flow.</p>
<p>I also liked the location. On the east side of Raleigh, it is just 2 miles from the nice Bartlett suburb. </p>
<p>It is 2 miles south of my other property, which helps if I want to switch to a local mom-and-pop sized property manager (which I think I prefer but haven&#8217;t done yet).</p>
<p>But the real kicker &#8211; it is walking distance to the major thoroughfare with a grocery store, restaurants, and shopping. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.39.59-AM-e1499615909645.png" alt="walking distance" width="600" height="592" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-474"></p>
<p>That can&#8217;t hurt!</p>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>I asked myself &#8211; should I put this property under contract or wait and see what else comes available?</p>
<p>The property checks a lot of the boxes and I lean towards taking action&#8230; </p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/what-if-im-not-picky-enough-next-rental-property-update/">What If I&#8217;m Not Picky Enough? Next Rental Property Update</a></em></p>
<p>Last week I signed on the dotted line and mailed in my $2500 earnest money deposit. Wahoo! My rental property empire is officially growing!</p>
<p>As soon as the ink was dry, my investment counselor (through Jason Hartman&#8217;s network) emailed a property for sale in the same ZIP code by a different provider. Even though the provider hadn&#8217;t gone through my personal vetting process, <strong>the curb appeal alone made my knees weak</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-09-at-8.29.29-AM-e1499617219290.png" alt="same zip code" width="500" height="374" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-477"></p>
<p>Built in 2001. Purchase price of $133k. Meets the 1% rent-to-income rule. I don&#8217;t know where exactly it is though and it has a Jacuzzi, which sounds like maintenance hell.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty good at looking forward and not second-guessing decisions. This picture really tested that ability.</p>
<h2>How Did I Do?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to soon have rental property number three join the portfolio!</p>
<p>In the first sentence of this article I said the process was <strong>short</strong> and <strong>not so hard</strong>. This is because I previously invested in my education, have been through this before, and already have some contacts.</p>
<p><strong>In calendar time it took about a month. Hours invested? Approximately 10 &#8211; mainly phone calls and online research.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What do you think &#8211; how did I do on this property?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Did I show investing in rental properties doesn&#8217;t have to be hard?</em></strong></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s give this article a soundtrack:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4tSE2w53ts" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>What am I so happy about? How about making $9,596 in six months with close to zero work!</p>
<p>Owning rental properties sure can be glorious. <strong>My portfolio is skating along nicely right now.</strong> Of course, it does take some setting up and you do have to put in a lot of time and energy in the beginning, not to mention it can be quite a hefty investment. If you&#8217;re starting a property business, you can get a <a href="https://l3funding.com/merchant-cash-advance">business cash advance</a> to help you cover the costs of any materials you may need or anything else, like legal documentation ad whatnot. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig into how I got to this point and the latest numbers.</p>
<h2>A Little Work Several Years Back</h2>
<p>I earned $9,596 with little effort because I put in the effort to purchase the properties a few years back.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t a ton of work&#8230; I purchased turnkey, fully rehabbed properties on the other side of the country. I still haven&#8217;t seen them. <strong>Most the effort was getting educated and developing the right mindset to take action.</strong></p>
<p>Then I sat back and relaxed.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://giphy.com/embed/Yy2H6trIkODoA" width="480" height="359" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I own two rental properties. </p>
<p>The first is in the Atlanta area, purchased in 2011 for $81,500. After closing costs, my initial investment was just $19,936. </p>
<p>The second property is in the Memphis area, purchased in 2014 for $93,000. My initial investment was $24,030. Many people who are looking to buy more than one property will consider a <a href="https://let-to-buy.uk/">let to buy mortgage</a> so that they can let out one property to buy the second. It can be a profitable venture but should certainly be considered in full before any decisions are made.</p>
<p>A little money, a little effort, but now I get to sit back and collect checks.</p>
<h2>The Last 6 Months</h2>
<p>The big news was finishing a cash out refinance on property 1. </p>
<p>The property appreciated so much, I was able to refinance it and get a check for $36k. Significantly more than my initial investment! <strong>BOOM!</strong></p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/cash-out-refinance-on-a-rental-property-my-actual-numbers/">Cash Out Refinance on a Rental Property – My Actual Numbers</a></em></p>
<p>I spent 6 to 8 hours on the phone with lenders, gathering documents, and signing lengthy contracts.</p>
<p>Even though I have this huge chunk of cash, I haven&#8217;t put it to work yet. It is just sitting in a savings account until I purchase my next rental. </p>
<p>So temporarily, this move actually <strong>hurt</strong> my bottom line. It cost about $2k in closing costs to access this money.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about the long game though. I&#8217;m setting up for even more profits in the future, as that cash equals the down payment on one and a half more rental properties! </p>
<p>More on this later, let&#8217;s look at the numbers first.</p>
<h2>Property 1 Numbers</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.34-PM.png" alt="property 1 h12017" width="1676" height="164" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-458" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.34-PM.png 1676w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.34-PM-300x29.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.34-PM-768x75.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.34-PM-1024x100.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1676px) 100vw, 1676px"></p>
<p>Even though the property just appraised for $130k, I decided to be conservative with a $123k value in my estimate.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s still up $6k. <strong>A thousand dollars a month straight to my net worth!</strong></p>
<p>Add in $1500 more for the tenant paying down the mortgage, cash flow, and tax benefits. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.40-PM.png" alt="july 2017 numbers property 1" width="2004" height="804" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-456" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.40-PM.png 2004w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.40-PM-300x120.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.40-PM-768x308.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.40-PM-1024x411.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.40-PM-2000x802.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 2004px) 100vw, 2004px"></p>
<p><strong>In six years, the total return of this property has been $55k. On an initial investment of $20k. You kidding me!?!?</strong></p>
<p>Compounded rate of return of 25% a year.</p>
<h2>Property 2 Numbers</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.05-PM.png" alt="property 2 h12017" width="1668" height="164" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-459" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.05-PM.png 1668w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.05-PM-300x29.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.05-PM-768x76.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-8.07.05-PM-1024x101.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1668px) 100vw, 1668px"></p>
<p>Appreciation here has been more modest, as expected. Memphis is an even more linear market than Atlanta. Flatter peaks and valleys.</p>
<p>The Zillow estimate actually went down, but I average it with Redfin and make small adjustments. The result is $1700 of appreciation in the last six months.</p>
<p>Big cash flow of $2k plus another $1k from the tenant paying down the mortgage and tax benefits. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.54-PM.png" alt="july 2017 numbers property 2" width="1992" height="626" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-457" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.54-PM.png 1992w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.54-PM-300x94.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.54-PM-768x241.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.54-PM-1024x322.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1992px) 100vw, 1992px"></p>
<p>In 3 years the total return is almost $17k.</p>
<p>Compounded rate of return of 19% a year. Not as good as the other, but pretty darn impressive.</p>
<h2>Overall Portfolio Numbers</h2>
<p>Those numbers don&#8217;t tell the whole story though. It is more accurate to do a cash flow analysis.</p>
<p>When you have an asset that spits off cash in addition to going up in value, it matters when you get that cash.</p>
<p>$1k received six years ago is more valuable than $1k received today. I can invest it and make extra money over that time. That&#8217;s what a cash flow analysis accounts for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-07-01-at-5.24.22-PM.png" alt="cash flow analysis" width="860" height="103" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-464" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-07-01-at-5.24.22-PM.png 860w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-07-01-at-5.24.22-PM-300x36.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-07-01-at-5.24.22-PM-768x92.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px"></p>
<p>Usually it is done monthly or yearly. As a happy medium between accuracy and simplicity, I opted to look at 6 month chunks of time. I used a discount rate of 2% per half year (basically what I think the money should earn pretty risk free).</p>
<p>So what has the portfolio earned over the last six years?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.22-PM.png" alt="july 2017 numbers" width="1492" height="90" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-455" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.22-PM.png 1492w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.22-PM-300x18.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.22-PM-768x46.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-30-at-7.24.22-PM-1024x62.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1492px) 100vw, 1492px"></p>
<p><strong>30% yearly return!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;ve earned $66k in that amount of time. Between the equity in the two properties and the refi cash waiting to be invested, the portfolio is worth $96k!</strong></p>
<h2>It Never Gets Old</h2>
<p>Aren&#8217;t those numbers exciting? Who is having fun here?</p>
<p>Now for a dose of perspective.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/perspective.gif" alt="perspective" width="640" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-460"></p>
<p>The biggest driver of return has been appreciation. I don&#8217;t believe this current run is sustainable. </p>
<p>My Atlanta property has appreciated 8% a year over the 6 years! That is incredible, but over a whole real estate cycle, I would expect it to settle closer to 3%. </p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/lets-visualize-real-estate-cycle/">How to Visualize the Real Estate Cycle</a></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not worried about it though. Even with 3% a year appreciation, basically the same as inflation, an investor can make a killing.</p>
<p>How? <strong>You only have to put 20% down and get 100% of the benefit.</strong> Multiply that 3% by 5 and you get 15% a year return from appreciation alone. You certainly won&#8217;t hear me complaining about that!</p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/thing-investors-dont-understand-leverage/">The Thing Most Investors Don&#8217;t Understand about Leverage</a></em></p>
<p>That was a dose of pessimism, now one more reason for excitement looking forward.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://giphy.com/embed/Ve20ojrMWiTo4?video=0" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Each individual property has done well, but there really hasn&#8217;t been any compounding effect yet. <strong>I want exponential growth!</strong></p>
<p>The only thing remotely exponential so far was that I used the $7k in cash flow over the first 3 years of property 1 towards purchasing property 2. Not a big effect considering that was less than a third of the initial investment.</p>
<p>But now?</p>
<p>Property 1 cloned itself and then some. The proceeds from just the cash out refinance will allow for the purchase of another rental property and a half. Add in the cash flow and it has earned enough for two more rentals! </p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/lets-double-cash-out-refinance-rental-property/">Let&#8217;s Double Down! Cash Out Refinance on a Rental Property</a></em></p>
<p><strong>Double the cash flow, double the mortgage pay down, double the appreciation, double the tax benefits. </strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m now on the compound returns level. Cue the music:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BsBXp6VkvU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I did a cash out refinance and will soon invest the proceeds into another rental property. One of my properties cloned itself!</p>
<p><em>       See: <a href="/lets-double-cash-out-refinance-rental-property/">Let&#8217;s Double Down! Cash Out Refinance on a Rental Property</a></em></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at why do it, my process, and the actual numbers.</p>
<h2>Compound Returns</h2>
<p>We all know compound interest is powerful &#8211; it is important to start early and all that. But when owning 100 shares of stock, it is a bit hard to see how that compounds.</p>
<p>If the stock goes up 50% in 7 years, you still own 100 shares. Is the company now 50% better at making money, accelerating the returns? Doubt it.</p>
<p>When a stock pays a dividend, you can save up those pennies to buy more shares. That makes the compounding a lot more understandable. Unfortunately not all stocks have dividends.</p>
<p>Compounding is much easier to understand with real estate investing. It is also manual &#8211; you have to actively do it.</p>
<p>You wait patiently for several years while the equity builds up, then you have a couple options for accessing that money. One is a cash out refinance. The other is a 1031 exchange, where you sell the property tax-free and reinvest the money into another property or two. If you are looking to a <a href="https://www.sofi.com/home-loans/mortgage-refinance/" alt="" title="">refinance mortgage</a> for your property it might be worth looking into a company similar to SoFi for more information. </p>
<p><em>       See: <a href="/cash-out-refinance-tax-free/">A Cash Out Refinance is Tax Free Money</a></em></p>
<p>You are in control. You get to decide when and how to go about it.</p>
<h2>Why Now?</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://How Do You Know When to Refinance Your Investment Properties/?">How Do You Know When to Refinance Your Investment Properties?</a> I went through the calculations in-depth. Let&#8217;s do a quick look.</p>
<p>I have had my Atlanta area property for almost 6 years. I bought it for $81.5k and estimated it was worth $116k back in my January portfolio update.</p>
<p><em>       See: <a href="/rental-property-portfolio-update-chowing-appreciation/">Rental Property Portfolio Update – Chowing Down on Appreciation</a></em></p>
<p>In the meantime, the mortgage balance dropped below $60k. Thank you to the tenant for paying that down for me!</p>
<p>According to my estimate, I have roughly $56k in equity ($116k value minus $60k mortgage balance). The bank owns approximately 52% and I own 48%.</p>
<p>That equity doesn&#8217;t earn a return. I want to put it to work, but it costs money to do a refinance. You are signing up for a new mortgage that replaces your old one. Closing costs, title, taxes, appraisal, etc.</p>
<p>It is a matter of balancing the benefits of compounding vs. the cost. From a pure numbers standpoint, it is better to put that equity to work as early as possible. Since my property was closing in on 50% equity, it was time.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>Refinancing is very similar to getting a mortgage in the first place. You have to submit a whole bunch of documents to satisfy debt-to-income requirements, credit score, cash reserves. It takes 30+ days to close. If you already know your cash reserves and credit score are low, you can look at <a href="https://www.ecomena.org/credit-cards-for-bad-credit/">Credit Cards for No Credit</a> and build up your credit. This way, you look more trustworthy and responsible to lenders and then they&#8217;re more likely to lend to you. Speaking of credit score, having a good credit history can be beneficial for a lot of things that you are going to want to buy later on in life, such as a house or a car. If you are looking to rent a property, most landlords will do a <a href="https://www.american-apartment-owners-association.org/tenant-screening/credit-checks/">tenant credit check</a> before they go any further with renting the property. With this being said, if you are only just applying for a credit card, making sure you <a href="https://www.lendingexpert.co.uk/credit-cards/">check if your eligible for a credit card</a>, as this will save you time before applying. </p>
<p><em>       See: <a href="/rental-property-loans-first-time-real-estate-investor-know/">Rental Property Loans – What The First Time Real Estate Investor Should Know</a></em></p>
<p>On a cash-out refinance, you are currently allowed up to a 75% loan-to-value ratio. That means, your new mortgage balance will be 75% of the value.</p>
<p>How do you know the value? You have to get an independent appraisal. A lot is riding on it, let&#8217;s look at an example.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a $50k mortgage you are refinancing and believe the property is worth around $100k. A 5% swing in appraisal price can have a pretty big affect on how much money you get back:</p>
<ul>
<li>$95k appraisal: $71,250 on the new mortgage = $21,250 cash (minus closing costs)</li>
<li>$100k appraisal: $75,000 on the new mortgage = $25,000 cash (minus closing costs)</li>
<li>$105k appraisal: $78,750 on the new mortgage = $28,750 cash (minus closing costs)</li>
</ul>
<p>See how big a difference the appraisal makes? It has a great deal of influence on how much money you get to reinvest into another property.</p>
<h2>My Process</h2>
<p>I have a mortgage guy. Doesn&#8217;t that sound so baller?</p>

<p>Really though, I have a guy who I used on both my investment properties. He was chill and more than willing to spend some serious time on the phone explaining things to a beginner.</p>
<p>I wanted to see what he can do on a refinance, but also get quotes from elsewhere. </p>
<p>There was one bank that works with investors I heard about on a podcast. Rather than package the loans and sell them to someone else to service them, they keep them. It sounded to me like they were able to remove a middleman and give some pretty competitive rates.</p>
<p>Then I was also going to see what I could get through the current mortgage holder. My mortgage got sold to Wells Fargo for servicing, so a huge national bank actually owns it. I briefly tried to get ahold of someone there who wasn&#8217;t an idiot, but it proved impossible. Plus being self-employed adds another layer of complexity, so I wasn&#8217;t confident they would be able to get it done.</p>
<p>Ok, so I had two different mortgage providers to compare. What comes next?</p>
<h2>Get Numbers on Paper</h2>
<p>I actually just start the process with both of them. Why? I think it is hard to get an apples-to-apples quote you can compare to someone else. There are just too many variables. </p>
<p>There are little hits to the rate for it being an investment, for cash out, for 75% LTV, and probably more. You aren&#8217;t going to get the 3% mortgage rate you see on a banner ad.</p>
<p>If you get a quick quote, you are likely to find out later in the process &#8211; oh we didn&#8217;t include the .1% increase for X. The bottom line quote to get you in the door, then it goes up from there.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is you have to later tell one of the companies you aren&#8217;t going to go through with it. It&#8217;s kind of like breaking up with someone &#8211; awkward but you know it has to be done. Hopefully you can tell them before they put the complete documents together which takes some effort.</p>
<p>One came in at least $500 cheaper and they were also more responsive. Let&#8217;s move forward!</p>
<h2>My Actual Numbers</h2>
<p>It started with a $525 appraisal that was billed directly to my credit card.</p>
<p>After getting the appraisal back, you get to decide if you want to move forward with the refinance. So while there is a lot riding on it, you do have a rip cord you can pull if it no longer makes sense. I would have been out the $525 though.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily my appraisal came back at $130k! I was conservatively expecting $115k, which means I was able to get pull out an extra $11k in cash!</strong></p>
<p>My new loan will be at $97.5k. With those proceeds I have to pay off the old mortgage and the closing costs.</p>
<p>What did it cost to access this money?</p>
<h3>All the Fees</h3>
<p>The fee from the mortgage provider is called many different things and sometimes broken into smaller line items. Add them all up and you have the origination charges. Mine were $825.</p>
<p>Title is a huge expense. It isn&#8217;t finalized, but I expect it to be $1300 to $1400.</p>
<p>You have a few small things like credit report, flood certification, recording fees, transfer taxes, and prepaid interest. Those all came to around $400.</p>
<h3>The Prepaids</h3>
<p>I had an escrow account before, but I have to start a new one with the new mortgage.</p>
<p>They want $2580 in the escrow account at the time of closing to cover 13 months of homeowners insurance and 10 months of property taxes.</p>
<p>The good news &#8211; once the old mortgage provider receives the funds to close out your loan, you are sent a check for everything in your previous escrow account. Mine is currently $2284.</p>
<p>Since it comes out essentially to a wash after a short delay <strong><em>and</em></strong> is still my money in a forced savings account, I&#8217;m going to exclude escrow from my analysis.</p>
<h3>My Interest Rate</h3>
<p>Before my rate was 5.5%. So even though <a href="/interest-rates-are-going-up-have-you-missed-the-boat/">interest rates are currently going up</a>, my rate for this property will go down.</p>
<p>The exact rate depends upon a number of factors and changes daily. Mine was just over 4.75%. I could get a 4.75% loan for +$122 in closing costs.</p>
<p>Then you have the option of moving up or down. You can pay more for a lower rate (mortgage points), or accept a higher rate with lower closing costs (lender credits).</p>
<p>I opted to take a 5% loan with $975 back in lender credits. More cash, more flexibility.</p>
<h3>Adding it All Up</h3>
<p>$525 appraisal<br>
$825 origination<br>
$1350 title<br>
$400 taxes / other<br>
-$975 lender credit<br>
= $2125</p>
<p>It would have been $3100 without lender credits, $2125 by accepting a rate increase to 5%. Not bad!</p>
<h2>The End Result</h2>
<p>How much cash do I get?</p>
<p>$97.5k new loan balance<br>
-$59.3k old loan balance<br>
-$2.1k closing costs<br>
= $36.1k</p>
<p>Wow! Excluding the small escrow changes and delay, I will get $36.1k back in this refinance. That is a huge chunk of change!</p>
<p><strong>The best part about it? I only paid $20k out of pocket 6 years ago!</strong></p>
<p>So not only am I <em>in</em> for $0 on this property, it also provided an extra $16k that I get to invest in another rental! That is incredible!</p>
<h3>The downside?</h3>
<p>My monthly payments go up, meaning cash flow goes down.</p>
<p>Right now my principle plus interest payments are $370. On the new mortgage it will go all the way up to $523. An increase of $153 a month.</p>
<p>That is most of the cash flow. Each month there is $207 of taxes and insurance, and $90 a month to the property manager.</p>
<p>With the rent currently at $1000, that leaves just $180 of &#8220;cash flow&#8221;. But that has to cover repairs and vacancies. If I&#8217;m honest, $180 a month won&#8217;t cover it, considering you have to save for big ticket items like a new roof someday.</p>
<p>The rent will increase though. It should be at $1100 to $1150 within 2 years, as that is more in line with the market rate for the area. We are increasing it $50 a year as long as the current tenant stays. If they move out, it will jump up (but there will be turnover costs, so I&#8217;m not hoping for this).</p>
<p>That will get me back to my pre-refi cash flow numbers. In the meantime, I&#8217;ll hold onto more reserves &#8211; some of that $36.1k will sit in a savings account.</p>
<h2>In Closing</h2>
<p>The cash out refinance is powerful stuff!</p>
<p>I am all about the long-term mindset. I know calculations show rental property investing is a homerun over one to two decades, thanks in large part to the power of compounding.</p>
<p>Now for the first time I&#8217;m actually experiencing it. If I thought it was cool before, I now consider it Miles Davis.</p>

Those without rentals: do you see how crazy powerful this compounding is with rental property investing? See why getting started now is so important?</strong></em></p>
<p>Those with rentals: how did I do on the rate and cost of the refi?</p>

<p class="entry-meta"><time class="entry-time">January 17, 2017</time>  </p></header><div class="entry-content">
<a class="entry-image-link" href="/rental-property-portfolio-update-chowing-appreciation/" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><img width="200" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chowing-down-on-appreciation-200x300.png" class="alignleft post-image entry-image" alt="chowing down on appreciation" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chowing-down-on-appreciation-200x300.png 200w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chowing-down-on-appreciation-684x1024.png 684w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/chowing-down-on-appreciation.png 735w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"></a><p>Cash flow rental property investors often describe appreciation as <strong>&#8220;icing on the cake&#8221;</strong>.</p>
<p>Meaning it is nice to have, but shouldn&#8217;t be the main reason you invest.</p>
<p>I am <strong>chowing down</strong> on that icing and it is <strong>SWEET!</strong></p>
<h2>Why I View Things Differently</h2>
<p>Appreciation isn&#8217;t a nice to have, to me it is the <strong>main driver of returns</strong>. </p>
<p>My goal is slightly <a href="/learned-meeting-investors/">different than most investors</a> &#8211; I want to build long-term wealth, not live off cash flow as soon as possible.</p>
<p>All cash flow for the next decade or two will be reinvested to achieve the <strong>snowball effect</strong> of growing the portfolio. All appreciation for the next decade or two will be reinvested as well (for example through a <a href="/lets-double-cash-out-refinance-rental-property/">cash out refi</a>). </p>
<p>There are <a href="/the-impressive-returns-of-remote-rental-property-investing/">5 components of return on rental properties</a> &#8211; I don&#8217;t care where I get the returns as long as they are big. With a multi-decade timeline, <strong>leveraged rental properties are the best investment</strong>, and I believe the biggest part of those returns will be appreciation.</p>
<h2>But I Don&#8217;t Chase Appreciation</h2>
<p>Cash flow is the margin of safety.</p>
<p>Real estate is known to have huge swings &#8211; it is very likely I will have underwater mortgages one day. That is when you owe more on the mortgage than the house is worth. </p>
<p>I won&#8217;t panic though, it will only be temporary. Since I&#8217;m looking at it from a <strong>decades long view</strong>, I will wait it out.</p>
<p>How do you wait it out? With cash flow!</p>
<p>For a normal year, I want a 10% cash return. This is the <strong>margin of safety</strong> for when disaster strikes and I have to replace the plumbing or something major. I will need to bring in professionals to get it sorted out and I want it done right, so whether I&#8217;m looking for a <a href="https://www.gdmenvironmental.com/">septic tank cleaning in Colorado Springs CO</a> service or new pipes being fitted, I want to make sure it is going to be done in the best and most efficient way.</p>
<p>What a contradiction &#8211; I invest in cash flow markets with the hope of big appreciation? </p>
<p>Bingo! That is how I <strong>manage the inherent risk of leverage</strong>. No need to gamble, going for a <strong>boring ol&#8217; 25% yearly return</strong> is good enough for me.</p>
<h2>2016 Actual Results</h2>
<p>I have two properties. A 3 bed, 2.5 bath in Atlanta purchased 5.5 years ago and a 3 bed, 2 bath in Memphis purchased 2.5 years ago. Out of pocket I <strong>invested $44k</strong> combined. </p>
<p>For 2016 the returns were:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,222 in cash flow (<a href="/roller-coaster-cash-flow-rental-property-investment/">even with the rough year in Memphis</a>)</li>
<li>$2,039 in tax benefits</li>
<li>$2,225 in mortgage pay down (my super-sophisticated term for amortization)</li>
<li><strong>$18,000 in appreciation!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#8217;t done my taxes yet, but I actually think I might show a loss in 2016. So all that cash flow is tax free, then some might be carried over to 2017. Yet I walked away with $2,222 more in the bank. Aren&#8217;t taxes great!</p>
<p>The equity news is even better. A year ago the portfolio value (equity) was $69k. Today it sits at $89k! I know <strong>stocks had a great year, but you aren&#8217;t going to beat that!</strong></p>
<h2>The Details</h2>
<p>Here is Atlanta:</p>

<p>And Memphis:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-17-at-9.10.57-AM.png" alt="2017 H1 Memphis numbers" width="1195" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-277" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-17-at-9.10.57-AM.png 1195w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-17-at-9.10.57-AM-300x99.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-17-at-9.10.57-AM-768x254.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-17-at-9.10.57-AM-1024x338.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1195px) 100vw, 1195px"></p>
<p>I made a slight change on how I determine the property value. I am now averaging the estimate found on Zillow and Redfin, then taking 95% of that for my estimate. Though I could always find a professional <a href="https://www.residencestyle.com/how-to-conduct-property-valuation-for-investing-in-brisbane/">property valuer</a> to get a pinpoint accurate value, for the moment it is not necessary. I&#8217;m not planning on selling just yet.</p>
<p>For the overall portfolio:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-17-at-9.21.37-AM.png" alt="H1 2017 portfolio numbers" width="714" height="53" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-276" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-17-at-9.21.37-AM.png 714w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-17-at-9.21.37-AM-300x22.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px"></p>
<p>Nice big numbers aren&#8217;t they? Though if you are into things like IRR, NPV, and discount rates, you can <a href="https://breakoutmentors.leadpages.co/leadbox/1422915f3f72a2%3A113ee7c3fb46dc/5708573640228864/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get the entire spreadsheet here</a><script data-leadbox="1422915f3f72a2:113ee7c3fb46dc" data-url="https://breakoutmentors.leadpages.co/leadbox/1422915f3f72a2%3A113ee7c3fb46dc/5708573640228864/" data-config="%7B%7D" type="text/javascript" src="https://breakoutmentors.leadpages.co/leadbox-1484695116.js"></script>.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>A 31% yearly rate of return on my portfolio! This is incredible considering my properties are passive investments without getting my hands dirty doing repairs or even collecting rent checks myself. </p>
<p>Although the scoreboard currently shows 31%, I expect that to come down to 25% when we progress through the entire <a href="/lets-visualize-real-estate-cycle/">real estate cycle</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things that will help with the overall portfolio return is when my <a href="/lets-double-cash-out-refinance-rental-property/">properties start cloning themselves</a>. Right now my Atlanta property is 49% paid off, which is awesome until you consider there is $57k in equity that <strong>isn&#8217;t earning a return</strong>. This year I will access part of that equity to invest in another property. That new property (the clone) will be all upside with <strong>no out of pocket expense</strong> from me in 2017 (just the original $19k in 2011).</p>
<p>The caveat being &#8211; there will be zigs and zags. I&#8217;ll keep checking in on the portfolio value every 6 months, but won&#8217;t cry if I don&#8217;t maintain a 31% yearly return.</p>
