<p>A mobile notary came over to my house last Friday with a huge stack of papers for me to sign. I&#8217;d heard about these types of <a href="https://precedentlegalca.com/">mobile notary support services washington d.c.</a> and those that are similar before, and they are all highly regarded in the eyes of law firms and others when important documents need to be signed as soon as possible. It tends to happen when lawyers find themselves under time pressure and they can&#8217;t get the job done themselves. Although, as long as it gets done, I don&#8217;t think it matters who does it. They&#8217;re all on the same side after all. That drew to an end a <strong>surprisingly long 95 days since my verbal commitment to the seller</strong>.</p>
<p>No, the slow part wasn&#8217;t the notary&#8230; The assumption is that the notary is what makes it a tedious process but as long as you go to <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/rachel-mintz-mobile-notary-public-los-angeles">a mobile notary in the Los Angeles area</a> (or the one in Washington) like Rachel Mintz did, then the process shouldn&#8217;t take too long.</p>

<h2>Recapping the Deets</h2>
<p>It is a big 5 bed, 2 bath in a Memphis suburb. Purchased for $105k should rent for $1100.</p>
<p><em>        Details on finding the property: <a href="/locked-third-rental-property-investment/">How I Locked Up My Third Rental Property Investment</a></em></p>
<p>Here is the after rehab video:</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZZiXMulYEQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>What Took So Long?</h2>
<p>The appraisal.</p>
<p>It started with a request from me in late July that the lender hold on ordering the appraisal. I wanted to make sure the rehab work was finalized, but I made a couple mistakes.</p>
<p>I thought I was delaying the appraisal <strong>and</strong> inspection, but the inspection had already been ordered. Ooops. The inspection and appraisal helped to value the house and ensure it was in good enough condition. Thankfully, we had sorted most of the problems. Before starting the job, we had checked for any signs of pests by contacting <a href="https://www.pestcontrolexperts.com/">https://www.pestcontrolexperts.com/</a>, so we knew the house was clean and hygienic. </p>
<p>The rehab was almost finished, so I just wanted to wait another few days. I thought there was still plenty of time before our original target closing date of mid-August. </p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t exactly on top of things though. My wife and I went from a Flagstaff family reunion, to Chicago to celebrate my mom&#8217;s 60th birthday, to Bigfork  Montana for a wedding. During the two week trip, real estate wasn&#8217;t always top of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/debbyryan-debby-ryan-3oKIPwO2M2VP0yWjFS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/source-1.gif" alt="insane week" width="640" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-516"></a></p>
<p>A week and a half went by before the bank reached out and said &#8220;can we order the appraisal?&#8221; I said &#8220;oops, go ahead&#8221;.</p>
<h2>The Appraisal Process</h2>
<p>Turns out I shouldn&#8217;t have delayed anyways because appraisals are slow going these days. I assumed it would have been like the last purchase I made in 2014. Given the tons of home sales in 2017, it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><em>        I should have read:<a href="/turnkey-rentals-2017-need-adjust-approach/">Turnkey Rentals in 2017: Why You Need to Adjust Your Approach</a></em></p>
<p>One of the issues that led to the financial crisis was appraisers weren&#8217;t exactly independent. Banks could choose who they used, going with appraisers who would do whatever the banks wanted &#8211; essentially always quickly giving back a good valuation.</p>
<p>Now there is an intermediary. The lender puts in a request to a separate appraisal scheduling company (who I will refer to as &#8220;the appraisal desk&#8221;). This company has a pool of appraisers they use, and assign someone without the bank being involved.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great and all, but boy did it slow things down! My lender&#8217;s communication with this outsourced appraisal desk was like a <strong>game of telephone: slow and unreliable</strong>. </p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/coin-music-video-talk-too-much-l0MZhvVaefR03KDok" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/giphy-9.gif" alt="game of telephone" width="480" height="270" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-517"></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I delayed the start 1.5 weeks accidentally</li>
<li>Appraisal is ordered and it takes 1 week for appraiser #1 to call the seller to schedule</li>
<li>The seller rejected the appraiser after he supposedly said he doesn&#8217;t use rentals as comps, so he requested it be reassigned to a new appraiser</li>
<li>Another week goes by before appraiser #2 reaches out</li>
<li>Appraiser #2 calls the seller and leaves a voicemail. Then he tells the appraisal desk he is too busy for the job, so turns it down.</li>
<li>That same day the seller calls appraiser #2 back and he agrees to take the job. They schedule a date and just have to let the appraisal desk know it&#8217;s back on.</li>
<li>The appraisal desk never gets back to him before the scheduled appraisal date, so appraiser #2 cancels the appointment</li>
<li>Meanwhile it has been assigned to appraiser #3, but it took another week for him to call and schedule for a week out</li>
<li>Appraiser #3 turns in the report to the appraisal desk, but there are unknown delays. Maybe they wanted to replace a comp or two?</li>
<li>Two weeks after the initial appraisal was submitted, I get a copy</li>
<li>Closing is scheduled for 1 week later</li>
</ul>
<p>What a mess!</p>
<p>It would have been so much easier if the appraisal desk had simply kept with appraiser #2 and replied to his emails. It seems like there was a 1 week delay any time someone contacted the appraisal desk. <strong>Maybe emails are printed and delivered by pony express?</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/giphy-11.gif" alt="pony express" width="245" height="140" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-519"></p>
<p><strong>Throughout this I was talking to my two contacts (seller and lender), trying to facilitate communication between two other people (appraisal desk and appraiser).</strong></p>
<p>When the mess with appraiser #2 was happening, my lender said: &#8220;You are way more involved at this point that 99% of buyers.&#8221;</p>
<p>To which I replied: &#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve lost confidence in your chain of communication and ability to get this done.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, the appraisal came back as expected ($105k) and everything was a go.</p>
<h2>What Did I Learn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes things don&#8217;t go as planned&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/Jalikml2XiUgw" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/giphy-10.gif" alt="fail gif" width="240" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-518"> </a></p>
<p>Just like working with a property manager, I found myself working the lender to instill a sense of urgency. If they had a task to take care of, I was making daily phone calls.</p>
<p>One of my take-aways is that the lender isn&#8217;t the only person I needed to worry about &#8211; whoever they outsource the appraisals to is important as well. I&#8217;m not sure I could have known this ahead of time, but I sure didn&#8217;t feel there was a good enough channel of communication between them. Or that the lender was on my side and hustling enough. When it comes to selling a property, I may prefer a buyer who can buy my property as fast as possible (click <a href="https://webuyhousesinatlanta.com/">https://webuyhousesinatlanta.com/</a> for more information) rather than putting it out on any website and waiting for homebuyers to reach out to me.</p>
<p>So next time I&#8217;ll probably go back to the lender (#1) I used on my first two properties (the refi was also through lender #2). It was a tiny more expensive, but worth it.</p>
<p>I also learned that I shouldn&#8217;t assume I know everything just because this is my 3rd rental property. It wasn&#8217;t exactly the same as last time and I made a small mistake because of it (while distracted with my personal life).</p>
<p>Fresh eyes with a beginner&#8217;s mindset next time.</p>
<h2>All Good Now</h2>
<p>The seller could have backed out and found another buyer since it was beyond our initially agreed upon window. Or the appraisal could have finally come back too low.</p>
<p>Even though it took a while, everything worked out in the end. So all things considered, waiting a bit longer is no big deal!</p>
<p><strong>I want to hear from you &#8211; have you had any surprises during a rental property closing process? Did it work out in the end?</strong></p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry, I still believe it is a phenomenal investment and <strong>the best way to build wealth for anyone young with enough time to be patient</strong>. Of course, those with little knowledge in this field can take the help of experienced advisors and <a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/Michael_Teys">Michael Teys</a> seems to be a fine example, but the person has to be immensely patient to be able to see the growth. </p>
<p>That being said, after a couple of months without a new article, it&#8217;s time to reevaluate the direction of this website and how I can best help people like you!</p>
<h2>What I Originally Thought</h2>
<p>Back in January 2016 when I started working on Rental Mindset in earnest <em>&#8230;not this Ernest&#8230;</em><br>
<a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/ernest-p-worrell-jim-varney-trjUtMbysPNLO" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/earnest.gif" alt="not this ernest" width="450" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-499"></a><br>
Here was my thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
I believe through my own research and experience that <strong>rental properties are a really powerful way to build wealth</strong>.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
I believe <strong>most people don&#8217;t really know it is an option for them. It&#8217;s not for everyone, but it should at least be considered</strong>. Through sharing my own experience, there is the potential to have a big impact on a few people&#8217;s lives.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
So I&#8217;ll use an <a href="https://bio.fm/carrd" alt="" title="">easy website builder</a> to start getting my thoughts out there. Then in about 9 months when I actually start adding more properties, there will be a lot to write about &#8220;live&#8221; and already a small audience. At that time I can look to <a href="https://www.ninjareports.com/increase-page-speed-for-seo/">increase your website speed</a> as the viewership increases.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Actually Happened</h2>
<p>Fast forward to September 2017 and I feel the need to rethink things. </p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/starwars-star-wars-episode-2-3ohuAjo92OfUc0DmIU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/giphy2.gif" alt="rethink things" width="480" height="208" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-500"></a><br>
Maybe the desire to rethink came from a Jedi mind trick? Regardless, here is my new thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
I <strong>still believe</strong> through my own research and experience that <strong>rental properties are a really powerful way to build wealth</strong>given that the rental property is in a good condition. For instance, if the roofs, doors, windows, basement, and foundation of the house are in good shape and health, then there is a good chance that the property owner will be in profit. However, if, for example, the foundation of the house is not in a good condition (and seems to be in an urgent need of repairs from firms like Helitech which is known to <a href="https://www.helitechonline.com/central-missouri/">foundation repair in Columbia</a> or similar locations), then is possible that the owner would get less value for the property.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
Anyway, I <strong>still believe</strong> most people don&#8217;t really know it (rental property) is an option for them. It&#8217;s not for everyone, but it should at least be considered. Through sharing my own experience, there is the potential to have a big impact on a few people&#8217;s lives.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
I have a website with a lot of thoughts out there and a <strong>growing audience</strong>. The actions I made on my portfolio and wrote about so far are <a href="/unknown-umbrella-signing-first-umbrella-insurance-policy/">purchasing an umbrella insurance policy</a>, <a href="/cash-out-refinance-on-a-rental-property-my-actual-numbers/">cash out refinance on property #1</a>, and <a href="/locked-third-rental-property-investment/">putting property #3 under contract</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
The &#8220;here is what I did&#8221;, how-to articles are my least favorite to write. And even though there has been some action, there really isn&#8217;t enough to have it be a major focal point or differentiator from other information out there. <strong>The biggest impact has been actual conversations with people, not one way information posts. From now on, this will be my focus.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Actual Conversations</h2>
<p>Comments on articles are the conversations that people see. But no matter how enticing I make it, many readers will never leave a comment. It is just not something they do.</p>
<p>One way these people interact is the <a href="/contact/">contact form</a>. Better yet is signing up for the <a href="https://breakoutmentors.lpages.co/leadbox/1407c2373f72a2%3A113ee7c3fb46dc/5751646390845440/" target="_blank" data-leadbox="https://breakoutmentors.lpages.co/leadbox/1407c2373f72a2%3A113ee7c3fb46dc/5751646390845440/" data-leadbox-id="1407c2373f72a2:113ee7c3fb46dc" rel="noopener">email list</a> and replying directly to me (that way I know they are in the club and not a first time visitor).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been surprised by my real life friends wanting to discuss real estate investing now as well. They knew I had a couple rental properties, and even before this website could have asked my about them, but didn&#8217;t. If I can positively impact my friend&#8217;s financial lives, that is a huge win (although I am a little concerned that market timing has the potential for them to have a bad experience and not stick with it).</p>
<p>There have also been conversations with people I previously didn&#8217;t know over the phone, email, Skype, and in person. I&#8217;ve found many of these to be high impact as well.</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s This All Mean?</h2>
<p>There are going to be several changes to Rental Mindset moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>More &#8220;Why&#8221; and big thinking articles (broadening into general finance and self-improvement, not just rental property investing), less &#8220;How To&#8221; and &#8220;Here&#8217;s What Happened&#8221;</li>
<li>Cover the &#8220;Here&#8217;s What Happened&#8221; with a short monthly update</li>
<li>Get my face and personality out there more so people can decide &#8220;yes, this is someone I&#8217;d be interested in talking to&#8221; or not</li>
<li>Get people on the email list to be &#8220;in the club&#8221; and connect directly with those people (over email, phone, video chat)</li>
<li>When one-on-one becomes too much, figure out groups, webinars, masterminds, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Here&#8217;s How You Can Help</h2>
<p>Would you be interested in being a part of a community?<br>

Since many of you haven&#8217;t read it yet, here it is!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I&#8217;ve always looked at things a bit differently than most, somehow devoid of the fear of looking stupid by going against the crowd.</p>
<p>Five years ago, at the age of 25, I quit my well-paying Silicon Valley tech job and blasted out this email to everyone I knew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever been to a wild and crazy retirement party? Well this Friday night is your chance – we are celebrating the fact that it is my last day of work and throwing an ABBA themed retirement bash.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right – a party featuring all ABBA music. Gems like Dancing Queen, Take a Chance on Me, Fernando, and Waterloo (you can look forward to both the English and Swedish versions).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a good time, although I could tell by the 2nd hour of ABBA not everyone was as into the music as I was&#8230;</p>
<p>That one action (leaving my job, not throwing an ABBA retirement party) put me on the path to financial freedom. I&#8217;m not there yet, but getting started is the hardest part. Whether you&#8217;re quitting your job, like me, applying for a <a href="http://www.easyfinance.com/blog/things-you-should-spend-your-money-on/">credit card with no credit history</a> or paying off a mountain of debt, the road to financial freedom is always bumpy but you have to persevere. It will be well worth it.
</p>
<p>Today I am a small business owner in an area I&#8217;m passionate about and building a passive income through investing in out-of-state rental properties.</p>
<h3>Where My Journey Began</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people are born on third base and go through life thinking they hit a triple<br>
-Barry Switzer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote struck me the first time I heard it. And not just because I love baseball.</p>
<p>Across the landscape of financial blogs there are people in many different positions, from broke to rich. If you are signed up for the Gen Y email list you know the hardships he had to overcome to get where he is today. Others are riddled with student loan debt that will take decades to repay. Then there are a few with millions in net worth.</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate to start my journey in an excellent position – I won the genetic lottery with a loving upper-middle class family in California suburbia. You could say I was born on third base.</p>
<p>Rather, I prefer to think of it this way: the ball was hit to the deepest part of the ballpark for me, all I had to do was hustle my way around the bases to get to third. There are many people who have the same advantages and decide to coast into second base.</p>
<p>The goal is to make it all the way to the home plate though: financial freedom. Reaching third base is worth zero runs.</p>
<h3>The Working World</h3>
<p>I entered the workforce in 2008 with an engineering degree from Stanford and no student loans. Terrific starting position.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is the place to be for tech jobs and I landed a role at an enterprise software company. Making pretty decent money too.</p>
<p>I just couldn&#8217;t imagine staying there forever. Or any company really. It&#8217;s so slow! I just don&#8217;t enjoy small talk around the water cooler. Keep doing this another thirty to forty years? No thank you.</p>
<p>After three years I knew the gig was up – it was time for me to move on to the next thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Escape-Anywhere/dp/0307465357/ref=as_li_bk_tl/?tag=rentalminds02-20&amp;linkId=448847ad094087f27cb5e4894b0fe52c&amp;linkCode=ktl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The 4 Hour Workweek</a><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="amznPsBmPixel_7895925" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; width: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?source=bk&#038;t=yomoyobo-20&#038;bm-id=default&#038;l=ktl&#038;linkId=448847ad094087f27cb5e4894b0fe52c&#038;_cb=1461163009731" alt="" width="0" height="0" border="0">  has a chapter about mini-retirements. It challenges the idea of waiting until 65 for a traditional retirement and proposes an alternative. Some call it a sabbatical – every few years taking several months off.</p>
<p>I knew if I was going to be finding a new job anyway, this would be a perfect opportunity to see the world.</p>
<p>So I quit, threw an ABBA party, moved out of my apartment, and started a new journey.</p>
<h3>The Second Chapter</h3>
<p>After traveling for 5 months, mostly in New Zealand, it was back to reality. I would have to work again eventually. The first retirement wasn&#8217;t meant to last.</p>
<p>But I got to thinking – if I don&#8217;t like the traditional workplace, it should be a fall back option, not the primary goal. This employment gap might be the best chance I have to start my own small business and work for myself in an area I&#8217;m passionate about.</p>
<p>It would mean going through a tough period with very little income, but if successful, I&#8217;d be in a much better position in the long run.</p>
<p>And if it didn&#8217;t work, at least I&#8217;d be able to go back to traditional employment knowing that I&#8217;d given it my all. No second guessing, wondering if there was a better way to make a living.</p>
<p>The business I started is <a href="http://breakoutmentors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1-on-1 mentoring for kids who are learning to code</a>. I&#8217;m able to make decisions to go about it the right way, not simply the easiest way to make money. I&#8217;m able to fit work around my life, not the other way around.</p>
<h3>But What About Financial Freedom?</h3>
<p>If I&#8217;m currently on third base, how do I reach home plate? My plan to get there is through passive income.</p>
<p>There is more than one path to financial freedom. Some recommend cutting expenses by doing things like making your own deodorant or getting your ketchup from the free packets at McDonald&#8217;s. Most advocate saving a huge chunk of money and reaching a certain account balance before retiring and living off a small percentage per year.</p>
<p>I want money to keep coming in and to be able to spend. I know I haven&#8217;t reached my peak spending years yet and don&#8217;t want to sit at home hoarding pennies.</p>
<p>Passive income sounds great. Everyone wants it. You just sit there and money keeps coming in? Sign me up!</p>
<p>Unfortunately there isn&#8217;t exactly a clear path that works for everyone. It is hard – you have to invest either time or money up front. It is also uncertain – your plan for riches might be a complete bust. Most people suck at rebounding from failure and never try again.</p>
<p>I believe it&#8217;s easiest to start earning passive income by investing both your money and your time.</p>
<p>Put your money to work because there is less competition – everyone wants passive income streams that require $0, so those methods are highly competitive. Instead invest your time in finding a better way to put your money to work and learn how to do it.</p>
<h3>Which Led Me to Rental Property Investing</h3>
<p>Rental properties are a proven way to build both wealth and passive income, with many using software packages (like <a href="https://getbrokerkit.com/home/7-ways-to-improve-your-real-estate-recruitment/">https://getbrokerkit.com/home/7-ways-to-improve-your-real-estate-recruitment/</a>) to help them with managing these properties. You purchase a property and a tenant pays you every month – if you do it right, substantially more than your expenses. Meanwhile the property is appreciating, the tenant is paying down the mortgage, and you get tax benefits. Most people don&#8217;t consider <a href="/the-impressive-returns-of-remote-rental-property-investing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all 5 components of return for rental properties</a>.</p>
<p>The world of real estate is huge. There are thousands of <a href="/want-guru-look-somewhere-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gurus</a> preaching hundreds of different ways to do things. There are expensive courses, workshops, and conferences. It is all very intimidating.</p>
<p>Yet the majority of failures are those who don&#8217;t get started at all. They worry over details and worst case scenarios &#8220;my cousin&#8217;s next door neighbor has a rental property where the tenant didn&#8217;t pay rent and used the bathtub as a toilet&#8221;. Most of the time you will find reasonable people who just want to look for <a href="https://www.delsuites.com/locations/north-york-furnished-apartments.php">apartments for rent north york</a> that are clean and simple, and are perfectly fine. But the worries bog people down.</p>
<p>They over analyze rather than taking a less than 100% perfect step 1. So how do you simplify step 1?</p>
<h3>My Plan</h3>
<p>I am starting with turnkey rental properties on the other side of the country. I live in San Francisco, which is too expensive for rental numbers to work. You want the rent each month to be <a href="/ratios-baby-invest-rentals-thousands-miles-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 1/100th of the purchase price</a>. In San Francisco it is closer to 1/300th.</p>
<p>Turnkey is when a company does a lot of the work for you. They buy distressed properties, fix them up, put a tenant in place, then sell the property to an investor. In the end you own the property and the turnkey company makes a profit for their work – their model is flipping homes, mine is holding for the long term benefits.</p>
<p>I hire professional property managers to take care of most the on-going work because <a href="https://www.propertymanagementgroup.com/">managing properties</a> is incredibly difficult when you have more than three. That allows it to be passive income, not a second job as a landlord.</p>
<p>Right now my typical deal might have a $100k purchase price, requiring 20% down plus closing costs for an initial investment of $23k. The property rents for $1k per month, and after all projected expenses, it will provide $150 per month in cash flow.</p>
<p>And remember, cash flow is just one aspect of the overall return. <a href="/behind-the-numbers-calculating-the-overall-return-of-my-rental-portfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Over the last four and a half years, my properties have produced a 29% annual return</a>. This is possible even with conservative investments thanks to low-risk leverage, which <a href="/thing-investors-dont-understand-leverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most people don&#8217;t understand</a>.</p>
<h3>My Advice</h3>
<p>Research rental property investing and consider if it will help you reach financial freedom. It&#8217;s not for everyone and there are always risks when doing something different. I write about my own personal journey and how I reduce my risk at <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rental Mindset</a>.</p>
<p>The number one book to for motivation is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680011/ref=as_li_bk_tl/?tag=rentalminds02-20&amp;linkId=3a11bb3ce3975049d642c61ef056f71e&amp;linkCode=ktl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" id="amznPsBmPixel_2383959" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; width: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?source=bk&#038;t=yomoyobo-20&#038;bm-id=default&#038;l=ktl&#038;linkId=3a11bb3ce3975049d642c61ef056f71e&#038;_cb=1461163073836" alt="" width="0" height="0" border="0">. It will drive home the goal of passive income through rental properties. Don&#8217;t expect to ever find a perfect how-to guide, there are some things you will have to figure out on your own.</p>
<p>For more on turnkey rental properties, I recommend a couple podcasts. The earliest episodes from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/passive-real-estate-investing/id1006557991?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passive Real Estate Investing</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/turnkey-real-estate-investing/id955254558?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turnkey Real Estate Investing</a> will provide a nice overview.</p>
<p>Even if rental properties aren&#8217;t your thing, find a way to add passive income streams that you control. There are many ways to go about it and as you level-up your game, you will recognize more and more opportunities around you.</p>
<p>Put your money to work. Start simple. Don&#8217;t let fear of failure stop you.</p>

<p>It is located in a Memphis suburb, currently being rehabbed by a top-notch turnkey company. Check it out!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.43.45-AM.png" alt="not great curb appeal" width="621" height="348" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-471" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.43.45-AM.png 621w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.43.45-AM-300x168.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px"></p>
<p>The curb appeal isn&#8217;t great but the numbers are. The purchase price of $105k will rent for $1150+ a month. That should make for a pretty good profit margin. Of course, the home needs some work doing before I can consider putting it on the rental market, but there isn&#8217;t that much to do. One of the first things that will probably need changing is the front door. It&#8217;s a bit worn and it isn&#8217;t very modern. When you&#8217;re putting a home on the market, it&#8217;s important to consider what most people will look for. For many potential buyers, they&#8217;re looking for more modern homes. This is why it&#8217;s important that I consider getting in contact with a <a href="https://www.kellywindowanddoor.com/doors/provia-replacement-doors-in-raleigh/">professional provia door installations</a> company to see if they can update the door and make the home look a little more modern. Hopefully, that will be a pretty good place to start with the curb appeal. </p>
<p>The curb appeal should be easily fixed, so I locked this house up! </p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/filmeditor-movie-comedy-3ohzdFvSAgvmXq6n2o/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/giphy-6.gif" alt="lock it up" width="320" height="237" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-470"></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the property and my decision-making process.</p>
<h2>The Before Rehab Video</h2>
<p>The turnkey company posts walk through videos on YouTube. Here is the property before rehab has started.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qp6T2hh1l_4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Often the before pictures are pretty horrendous. That&#8217;s what these turnkey flippers specialize in &#8211; take an ugly house and improve it.</p>
<p>A property that will eventually be flipped to an investor at $105k might cost around $60k pre-rehab. With $25k of work put into it, including financing and other expenses, they can turn a profit of $20k. That is if everything goes according to plan. They have the risk and have to execute quickly.</p>
<p>As you can see, this property is in pretty good shape. It was built in the 1960s, but fixed up about 10 years ago. Most of it will be improved again.</p>
<p>What will the inside look like after rehab? Take a look at this video of a finished property by the same company.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6rL5aFZfEM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>The Search</h2>
<p>This is me searching for rental properties.</p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/focusworld-focus-world-in-a-valley-of-violence-l2JhORT5IFnj6ioko" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/giphy-5.gif" alt="search for rental property" width="480" height="198" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-469"></a></p>
<p>I do my best work in a cowboy hat&#8230;</p>
<p>My actual process is to first decide the city, then decide a couple of turnkey companies I like in that city.</p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/starting-search-next-rental-property-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starting the Search for My Next Rental Property Investment</a> </em></p>
<p>All my properties so far have been through Jason Hartman&#8217;s investment network to make this a little easier. They currently work with 6 of the best turnkey companies in Memphis.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make the mistake of stopping there and waiting for properties to get posted to the website. In 2017 things move fast. </p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/turnkey-rentals-2017-need-adjust-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turnkey Rentals in 2017: Why You Need to Adjust Your Approach</a></em></p>
<p>You also probably want to filter those 6 providers down even further. Not all of them fit my criteria. </p>
<p>Some had numbers that were consistently not all that impressive. A couple were too big (100+ flips a year) which makes me worry about their quality and my voice being heard. Others weren&#8217;t strong communicators.</p>
<p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/mad-men-flirt-seduce-jd4YLfyVaHqik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/giphy-7.gif" alt="communicate" width="343" height="315" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-475"></a></p>
<p>I found 2 that I liked out of the 4 or 5 companies I researched. So that narrowed my search scope of potential properties considerably.</p>
<p>Both of those companies do around 60 turnkey flips a year, selling 5 rental properties a month to investors. It might take them roughly 1 month to buy the property and 1 month to do the rehab.</p>
<p>In 2017 most properties are put under contract before the rehab is finished. This means to get first dibs, you are committing to a property before it is rehabbed.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it is so important to focus on individual turnkey companies. That is the product you are buying, not the house.</p>
<p><strong>You are essentially buying the ability for the turnkey company to deliver an impressive property that appraises as expected. Someone with integrity who will fix anything uncovered by the inspection report. </strong></p>
<p>You still have the ability to back out later if you can&#8217;t agree on what should be fixed on the inspection report. It&#8217;s less than ideal though because you are out the price of the inspection (maybe $250) and a lot of time invested, including getting your financing in place.</p>
<h2>The Location</h2>
<p>My original Memphis property is in the Raleigh-Bartlett area, northwest of the city. It is a 20-25 minute drive to downtown.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.41.00-AM.png" alt="memphis map" width="461" height="385" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.41.00-AM.png 461w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.41.00-AM-300x251.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px"></p>
<p>I liked the area three years ago when I researched more thoroughly. The other area with a lot of turnkey investments to compare it to is south of downtown, by the airport.</p>
<p>Both have very solid job opportunities, but I liked the long term prospects of the northwestern suburbs a little more. More opportunity for growth to the north, touching on a very nice suburb of Bartlett, and not as old.</p>
<p>I did a little research comparing the suburbs again but largely trusted what I decided three years ago. Of course, I was open to the right deal elsewhere if necessary.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you know it, one of the two providers had a property in that area they were in the process of purchasing.</p>
<h2>The Details</h2>
<p>I thought I wasn&#8217;t interested when I first saw the property. </p>
<p>Built in 1968, it is way older than my other two rental properties that were built in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Plus the curb appeal sucked. First, the fact that it was an older property, but also the front yard is mostly dirt because of a huge tree that provides a little too much shade for healthy low-maintenance grass.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-10.14.55-AM.png" alt="that's a lot of dirt" width="633" height="473" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-473" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-10.14.55-AM.png 633w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-10.14.55-AM-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px"></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of dirt! But it is also before rehab&#8230; a little work can go a long way, but I don&#8217;t think it will ever be that impressive on the curb appeal. It would take a lot of work, and would probably be too much for me to take on. One of my friends was recently telling me about <a href="https://www.lawncare.net/">https://www.lawncare.net/</a>. She said they&#8217;d probably be able to improve the curb appeal of this house. This house would require a lot of jobs doing, from trying to plant a new lawn to cutting that tree slightly. It would probably need a professional landscaper to give it a good go!</p>
<p>Even with a freshened up lawn, the curb appeal could be increased by altering the exterior of the house; the windows, door, and roof combined make the home look very plain and dated. New windows could be installed to freshen up the house, as well as a more modern door, and inspiration could be taken from <a href="https://www.thinkbordner.com/kansas-city/roofing-contractors/">kansas city roofs</a> to perhaps replace it in a bid to make the building look more lively. These are all additions that&#8217;ll give the house some much-needed curb appeal. When replacing windows, it&#8217;s so important to consider looking into fiberglass windows. These are believed to be stronger than average windows, giving homeowners more protection from weather events. Perhaps this <a href="https://lifetimewindowscolorado.com/">window replacement company denver</a> could be useful to contact if anyone else has purchased an investment property in that area. If not, just search for window replacement companies local to you. They should be able to recommend the best windows to improve curb appeal. </p>
<p><strong>The numbers met my requirements though. With a purchase price of $105k and a rent of $1150 per month, which gives a 1.1% ratio. Great!</strong></p>
<p>One of the things you have to consider &#8211; is the rent projection believable? In this case, I believe it is. We might even be able to get more the first year! </p>
<p>The property is huge at 2200 square feet &#8211; 5 bedrooms plus an office or walk-in closet, 2 bathrooms. It looks like a freshly rehabbed 4/2 might be around $1150 a month, so a 5+/2 might draw a little bit of a premium. I&#8217;m also intrigued by the idea that a large family or someone with a lot of stuff to store is less likely to move. Keeping tenants for a long time is a huge factor for cash flow.</p>
<p>I also liked the location. On the east side of Raleigh, it is just 2 miles from the nice Bartlett suburb. </p>
<p>It is 2 miles south of my other property, which helps if I want to switch to a local mom-and-pop sized property manager (which I think I prefer but haven&#8217;t done yet).</p>
<p>But the real kicker &#8211; it is walking distance to the major thoroughfare with a grocery store, restaurants, and shopping. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-08-at-8.39.59-AM-e1499615909645.png" alt="walking distance" width="600" height="592" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-474"></p>
<p>That can&#8217;t hurt!</p>
<h2>The Decision</h2>
<p>I asked myself &#8211; should I put this property under contract or wait and see what else comes available?</p>
<p>The property checks a lot of the boxes and I lean towards taking action&#8230; </p>
<p>          <em>See: <a href="/what-if-im-not-picky-enough-next-rental-property-update/">What If I&#8217;m Not Picky Enough? Next Rental Property Update</a></em></p>
<p>Last week I signed on the dotted line and mailed in my $2500 earnest money deposit. Wahoo! My rental property empire is officially growing!</p>
<p>As soon as the ink was dry, my investment counselor (through Jason Hartman&#8217;s network) emailed a property for sale in the same ZIP code by a different provider. Even though the provider hadn&#8217;t gone through my personal vetting process, <strong>the curb appeal alone made my knees weak</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-09-at-8.29.29-AM-e1499617219290.png" alt="same zip code" width="500" height="374" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-477"></p>
<p>Built in 2001. Purchase price of $133k. Meets the 1% rent-to-income rule. I don&#8217;t know where exactly it is though and it has a Jacuzzi, which sounds like maintenance hell.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty good at looking forward and not second-guessing decisions. This picture really tested that ability.</p>
<h2>How Did I Do?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to soon have rental property number three join the portfolio!</p>
<p>In the first sentence of this article I said the process was <strong>short</strong> and <strong>not so hard</strong>. This is because I previously invested in my education, have been through this before, and already have some contacts.</p>
<p><strong>In calendar time it took about a month. Hours invested? Approximately 10 &#8211; mainly phone calls and online research.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What do you think &#8211; how did I do on this property?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Did I show investing in rental properties doesn&#8217;t have to be hard?</em></strong></p>
